# ftp

Thin wrapper around the apache commons ftp-client.

## Usage

Usage example:

(def *connection* {
                 :url "ftp.server.url",
                 :user "username",
                 :password "password",
                 :transfer-mode :binary})
;; Transfer-mode may be one of :binary or :ascii if none is specified it will be :binary 

(with-ftp *connection*
  ((exists-remotely? "some/file")))

;; Binding of ftp-client to the ftp-client, so any method can be called on the client-api
(with-ftp-client ftp-client *connection*
  (.logout ftp-client)
  (prn (exists-remotely? "some/file")))

The last example will throw a SocketException, because the connection is closed when then exists-remotely method is called ;-)
