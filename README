# ftp

Thin wrapper around the apache commons ftp-client.

## Usage

Usage example:

(def connection {
                 :url "ftp.server.url",
                 :user "username",
                 :password "password",
                 :transfer-mode :binary)

(with-ftp connection
  (prn (exists-remotely? "some/file")))

;; Binding of ftp-client to the ftp-client, so any method can be called on the client-api
(with-ftp-client ftp-client connection
  (.logout ftp-client)
  (prn (exists-remotely? "some/file")))

The last example will throw a SocketException, because the connection is closed when then
exists-remotely method is called.
